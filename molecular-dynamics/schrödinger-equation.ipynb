    "\n",
    "## **Motivation**\n",
    "The Schrödinger equation is the foundation of quantum mechanics, describing how quantum systems evolve and behave. The 3D particle in a box is a simple model that demonstrates:\n",
    "- **Quantum Confinement**: How particles are restricted to specific regions in space.\n",
    "- **Energy Quantization**: The emergence of discrete energy levels due to confinement.\n",
    "- **Wavefunctions and Probability Densities**: Insights into the spatial distribution of quantum particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a gateway to understanding more complex systems, such as atoms, molecules, and nanostructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Code Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n",
    "For a particle confined in a rectangular box with dimensions $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$, the energy eigenvalues are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{n_x^2}{L_x^2} + \\frac{n_y^2}{L_y^2} + \\frac{n_z^2}{L_z^2} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers ($n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n",
    "- $L_x, L_y, L_z$ are the dimensions of the box.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2. Wavefunctions**\n",
    "The wavefunction for a 3D box is separable:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\psi(x, y, z) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L_x}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_x \\pi x}{L_x}\\right) \n",
    "\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L_y}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_y \\pi y}{L_y}\\right) \n",
    "\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L_z}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n_z \\pi z}{L_z}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Each component is a sine function, and the product gives the full spatial wavefunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Highlights**:\n",
    "- **`wavefunction_3d`** calculates the wavefunction for a grid of points $(x, y, z)$.\n",
    "- The function is normalized for probabilistic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Probability Density**\n",
    "The probability density represents the likelihood of finding a particle at a specific point:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "|\\psi(x, y, z)|^2\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "This is computed as the square of the wavefunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Highlights**:\n",
    "- The 3D probability density is evaluated on a spatial grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Visualization**\n",
    "### **Isosurface Representation**\n",
    "To visualize the 3D probability density:\n",
    "- A grid of points $(x, y, z)$ is generated.\n",
    "- Points where the probability density exceeds a threshold are plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Highlights**:\n",
    "- **`ax.scatter`** is used to display regions of high probability density.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Steps in the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Compute Energies**\n",
    "- The **`energy_3d`** function calculates energy eigenvalues based on quantum numbers and box dimensions.\n",
    "- Energies are sorted, and corresponding quantum numbers are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Calculate Wavefunctions**\n",
    "- The **`wavefunction_3d`** function computes the wavefunction using sine functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Generate 3D Probability Density**\n",
    "- The probability density is computed on a 3D spatial grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Visualize Probability Density**\n",
    "- The probability density is visualized as clusters of points where the density exceeds a specified threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Relevance**\n",
    "1. **Fundamental Insights**:\n",
    "   - Demonstrates how quantum systems behave under confinement.\n",
    "   - Shows the origin of quantized energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applications**:\n",
    "   - **Nanotechnology**: Explains the behavior of electrons in quantum dots.\n",
    "   - **Material Science**: Provides intuition for band structures in solids.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Educational Value**:\n",
    "   - Serves as a foundation for understanding more complex quantum systems, such as molecules and multi-electron atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Extensions**\n",
    "1. **Add External Potentials**:\n",
    "   - Introduce additional potentials (e.g., harmonic oscillators) to study perturbations.\n",
    "2. **Multi-Particle Systems**:\n",
    "   - Extend the model to include particle interactions.\n",
    "3. **Advanced Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Use volumetric rendering to better represent 3D wavefunctions.\n",
