# **numerical-fortran Repository**

Welcome to my numerical-fortran repository! In this collection, you will find implementations of numerical algorithms often covered in advanced numerical analysis courses, written in Fortran (short for **Formula Translation**). Fortran is a powerful language designed for scientific and numerical computation, and is known for its efficiencyâ€”often outperforming interpreted languages like Python for heavy numerical tasks.
